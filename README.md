# Presentation

Hi ! Welcome in our portfolio, we are two french students in last year of engineering school:

-Lucas Lesage, student at Polytech Grenoble

-Nicolas de Kerleau, student at Ensimag Grenoble INP


We are both studying IT , ranging from Networks, Multimedia and Programming. As engineer students, we also learned Software engineering and various qualities aspects of softwares in the professional field.

We also are avid gamers, having played numerous games ever since we are child. But we are as much interested in its development, hence the reason why we have been developing games on Unity for 1.5 year as of now.

We have created different projects to learn Unity by ourselves, in particular a FPS appropriately named SpuctreFPS. The goal in this project is to build a game with various functionnalities such as Online gaming, 3D manipulation and fast-paced action. As said earlier, we love playing video games, and creating our own game is a valuable experience to us.

Here is a link to our last video about the game : https://youtu.be/q6gJwUQXt0E
